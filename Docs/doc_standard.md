<h1>Documentation Standard</h1>

This document will serve as a guide and example of some rules that need to be
followed in order to contribute to the documentation.

We use a mix of markdown and HTML tags to customize the documentation along with an
[`extra.css`](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/Docs/extra.css) file.

Rules
-----

  * Leave always an empty line between sections and at the end of the document.
  * Writting should not exceed `100` columns, except for HTML related content, markdown tables,
  code snipets and referenced links.
  * If an inline link exceeds the limit, use referenced `[name][reference_link]` markdown notation
  `[reference_link]: https://` rather than `[name](https://)`.
  * Use `<br>` to make inline jumps rather than leaving two spaces at the end of a line.
  * Use `<h1>Title</h1>` at the beggining of a new page in order to make a Title or
  `<hx>Heading<hx>` to make a heading that **won't show** on the navigation bar.
  * Use `------` underlining a Heading or `#` hierarchy to make headings and show them in the
  navigation bar.

<h3>Exceptions:</h3>

  * Documentation generated via python scripts like PythonAPI reference
