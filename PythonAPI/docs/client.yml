        If we use some folder in the name, then it will be considered to be an absolute path, like '/home/carla/recording.log'.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: stop_recorder
      params:
      doc: >

    - def_name: show_recorder_file_info
      params:
      - param_name: filename
        type: str
        doc: >
          Name of the recorded file to load

        type: bool
        doc: >
          Show all detailed info, or just a summary
      doc: >
        Will show info about the recorded file (frames, times, events, state, positions...)
        We have the option to show all the details per frame, that includes all the traffic light states, position of all actors, and animations data.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: show_recorder_collisions
      params:
      - param_name: filename
        type: str
        doc: >
          Name of the recorded file to load
      - param_name: category1
        type: single char
        doc: >
          Character specifying the category of the first actor
      - param_name: category2
        type: single char
        doc: >
          Character specifying the category of the second actor
      doc: >
        This will show which collisions were recorded in the file. We can use a filter for the collisions we want, using two categories.
        The categories can be:  
          'h' = Hero  
          'v' = Vehicle  
          'w' = Walker  
          't' = Traffic light  
          'o' = Other  
          'a' = Any  
        So, if you want to see only collisions about a vehicle and a walker, we would use for category1 'v' and category2 'w'.
        Or if you want all the collisions (filter off) you can use 'a' as both categories.

    - def_name: show_recorder_actors_blocked
      params:
      - param_name: filename
        type: str
        doc: >
          Name of the recorded file to load
      - param_name: min_time
        type: float
        doc: >
          How many seconds has to be stoped an actor to be considered as blocked
      - param_name: min_distance
        type: float
        doc: >
          How many centimeters needs to move the actor in order to be considered as moving, and not blocked
      doc: >
        Shows which actors seem blocked by some reason.
        The idea is to calculate which actors are not moving as much as 'min_distance' for a period of 'min_time'.
        By default min_time = 60 seconds (1 min) and min_distance = 100 centimeters (1 m).
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: replay_file
      params:
      - param_name: name
        type: str
        doc: >
          Name of the file.
      - param_name: start
        type: float
        doc: >
          Time in seconds where to start the playback. If it is negative, then it starts from the end.
      - param_name: duration
        type: float
        doc: >
          Id of the actor to follow. If this is 0 then camera is disabled
      - param_name: follow_id
        type: int
        doc: >
      doc: >
        Playback a file
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: set_replayer_time_factor
      params:
      - param_name: time_factor
        type: float
        doc: >
          A value of 1.0 means normal time factor.
          A value < 1.0 means slow motion (for example 0.5 is half speed)
          A value > 1.0 means fast motion (for example 2.0 is double speed)
      doc: >
        Apply a different playback speed to current playback. Can be used several times while a playback is in curse.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: apply_batch
      params:
      - param_name: commands
        type: list
        doc: >
          A list of commands to execute in batch. Each command has a different number of parameters.
          Currently, we can use these [commands](#command.ApplyAngularVelocity):  
            SpawnActor  
            DestroyActor  
            ApplyVehicleControl  
            ApplyWalkerControl  
            ApplyTransform  
            ApplyVelocity  
            AplyAngularVelocity  
            ApplyImpulse  
            SetSimulatePhysics  
            SetAutopilot  
      doc: >
        This function executes the whole list of commands on a single simulation step.
        For example, to set autopilot on some actors, we could use:  
        [sample_code](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/10c5f6a482a21abfd00220c68c7f12b4110b7f63/PythonAPI/examples/spawn_npc.py#L126)  
        We don't have control about the response of each command. If we need that, we can use apply_batch_sync().

    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: apply_batch_sync
      params:
      - param_name: commands
        type: list
        doc: >
          A list of commands to execute in batch. For a list of commands available see function above apply_batch().
      return: list
      doc: >
        This function executes the whole list of commands on a single simulation
        step, blocks until the commands are executed, and returns a list of
        [`command.Response`](#command.Response) that can be used to determine whether a single
        command succeeded or not.
